_bio_
Lord Rolex, born Anthony Edward Requena, was introduced to the MPC at sixteen and has been perfecting his craft since. Landing somewhere between DJ Premiere and Zaytoven, the producer embodies the grit and confidence required to survive in his hometown of Pacoima. Recognized for his blend of aggresive, symphonic sound and hip-hop soul, he and Stanley Vaughn released their first collaboration, Eskimo Society in 2014.
